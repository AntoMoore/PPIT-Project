# Use of augmented reality in hip pinning surgeries

This is a project investigating whether augmented/mixed reality can be applied to assist a surgeon during a hip pinning operation. X-rays from the image intensifier could be provided in real-time to the surgeon via a heads-up-display, providing the image in their eye-line and assisting them in calculating drill points and measuring angles.
